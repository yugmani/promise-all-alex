            Promises are objects that represent some value. The value is not
            determined at the time of creating a promise. But this value will be
            determined in the future when a promise is resolved or rejected.
          </li>
          <li>
            Promises make writing asynchronous code much easier and more
            manageable.
          </li>
          <li>
            For example: When our application needs to fetch data from some API,
            we don't know when will we receive this data. Sometimes, we get them
            immediately and sometimes it might take more time. It is not
            convenient to check the data in specific intervals nor keep waiting
            for long time. Using Promise is the solution to overcome from this
            problem. When Promise is settled ( resolved or rejected ), it
            automatically triggers events that we can listen to with specific
            handler methods and our app gets updated.
